# Multiprogramming Operating System

Welcome to the **Multiprogramming Operating System** project! üéâ This project simulates a multiprogramming environment, implementing various phases of execution and management. Below, you'll find an overview of the three phases and their functionalities.

## Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Instruction Processing üß©

**Description**: In this phase, the system processes instructions and handles basic memory operations. It reads instructions from an input file, executes them, and writes results to an output file.

**Key Features**:
- **Instruction Register (IR)**: Stores the current instruction being executed.
- **Memory Management (M)**: A simulated memory array used for storing and manipulating data.
- **File Operations**: Manages reading from an input file and writing results to an output file.

### Phase 2: Memory Management üóÉÔ∏è

**Description**: This phase enhances the functionality of Phase 1 by incorporating advanced memory management techniques. It includes dynamic memory allocation and deallocation strategies to efficiently manage system resources.

**Key Features**:
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Adjusts memory allocation based on the job's requirements.
- **Deallocation**: Frees up memory once a job is complete to optimize resource usage.

### Phase 3: Advanced Job Handling üõ†Ô∏è

**Description**: The final phase introduces more sophisticated job handling mechanisms, including multi-job processing and improved data management. This phase ensures smooth execution of multiple jobs with efficient resource utilization.

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-Job Processing**: Supports running multiple jobs concurrently.
- **Enhanced Data Management**: Improves handling of data and job instructions for better performance and reliability.
